For the rename of "GetCandy" to "Lunar" we built a [landing page](https://lunarphp.io/) that features buttons/links with an animated gradient border hover effect... ðŸ« 

And, surprisingly, it was easy. Here's how I did it...

### Faking the Border

First, we need our interactive element, for this example, I'll use an `<a>` to have a "border" which we are faking by using a background color and padding.

```html
<a href="#" class="inline-block bg-white p-0.5">
  <span class="block px-5 py-3 text-white bg-slate-900"> Get Started </span>
</a>
```

Inside that, we add a `<span>` that will have the text content of the element, as well as apply the padding that we desire for our button/link.

### Adding the Gradient

Next, we need to add the gradient.

I'm going to use a pre-made Tailwind CSS gradient from [Hypercolor](https://hypercolor.dev/).

We apply the gradient to the interactive element with the fake border.

```html
<a
  href="#"
  class="inline-block bg-white from-pink-500 via-red-500 to-yellow-500 p-0.5"
>
  <span class="block px-5 py-3 text-white bg-slate-900"> Get Started </span>
</a>
```

You might be concerned that the gradient classes added will override the `bg-white` but it won't, for that to happen we need to add the gradient direction class which is done on hover.

### Applying the Hover Effect

We can take what we've done and add two more classes, one is a default Tailwind CSS class which is applied on hover, the other is always applied and needs some JIT magic.

```html
<a
  href="#"
  class="inline-block bg-white from-pink-500 via-red-500 to-yellow-500 p-0.5 bg-[length:400%_400%] hover:bg-gradient-to-r"
>
  <span class="block px-5 py-3 text-white bg-slate-900"> Get Started </span>
</a>
```

Let's break these down.

`hover:bg-gradient-to-r`

This applies the gradient direction class only on hover which will make the gradient display instead of `bg-white`.

`bg-[length:400%_400%]`

This makes the gradient huge allowing us to apply an animation to it, without this class the gradient will appear as is and wont animate.

### Animating the Gradient

Now it's time to animate.

First, we need to make some additions to our Tailwind CSS config.

```js
theme: {
  extend: {
    animation: {
      border: 'border 4s ease infinite',
    },
    keyframes: {
      border: {
        '0%, 100%': { backgroundPosition: '0% 50%' },
        '50%': { backgroundPosition: '100% 50%' },
      },
    },
  },
}
```

Here we're creating an animation with the class `animate-border` which is using the `border` object in the `keyframes` object. In short, this moves the gradient.

Finally, we can add the `animate-border` class to the interactive element with the gradient classes.

The full example looks like this.

```html
<a
  href="#"
  class="animate-border inline-block bg-white from-pink-500 via-red-500 to-yellow-500 p-0.5 hover:bg-gradient-to-r bg-[length:400%_400%] "
>
  <span class="block px-5 py-3 text-white bg-slate-900"> Get Started </span>
</a>
```
