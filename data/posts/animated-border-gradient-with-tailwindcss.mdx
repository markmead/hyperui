For the rename of "GetCandy" to "Lunar" we built a [landing page](https://lunarphp.io/) that features buttons/links with an animated gradient border hover effect... ðŸ« 

And, surprisingly, it was easy. Here's how I did it...

### Faking the Border

First, we need our interactive element, for this example, I'll use an `<a>` to have a "border" which we are faking by using a background color and padding.

```html
<a href="#" class="inline-block bg-white p-0.5">
  <span class="block px-5 py-3 bg-white"> Get Started </span>
</a>
```

Inside that, we add a `<span>` that will have the text content of the element, as well as apply the padding that we desire for our button/link.

### Adding the Gradient

Next, we need to add the gradient. I'm going to grab a pre-made Tailwind CSS gradient from [Hypercolor](https://hypercolor.dev/).

We apply this gradient to the interactive element with the fake border, in the example, this is the `<a>` element.

```html
<a
  href="#"
  class="inline-block bg-white from-pink-500 via-red-500 to-yellow-500 p-0.5"
>
  <span class="block px-5 py-3 bg-white"> Get Started </span>
</a>
```

You might be concerned that the gradient classes added will override the `bg-white` but it won't, for that to happen we need to add the gradient direction class which we do on hover.

### Applying the Hover Effect

We can take what we've done and add two classes on hover, one is a default Tailwind CSS class, the other needs some JIT magic.

```html
<a
  href="#"
  class="inline-block bg-white from-pink-500 via-red-500 to-yellow-500 p-0.5 hover:bg-gradient-to-r bg-[length:400%_400%]"
>
  <span class="block px-5 py-3 bg-white"> Get Started </span>
</a>
```

Let's break these down.

**`hover:bg-gradient-to-r `**

This applies the background gradient direction class only on hover which will make the gradient display instead of `bg-white`.

**`bg-[length:400%_400%]`**

This makes the background gradient massive allowing us to apply a spin animation to show movement.

### Animating the Gradient

Now it's time to animate.

First, we need to make some additions to our `tailwind.config.js` file.

```js
theme: {
  extend: {
    animation: {
      border: 'border 4s ease infinite',
    },
  keyframes: {
    border: {
      '0%, 100%': { backgroundPosition: '0% 50%' },
      '50%': { backgroundPosition: '100% 50%' },
    },
  },
},
```

Here we're creating an animation that we can use as `animate-border` which under the hood is moving the position of the background gradient.

And finally, add the `animate-border` class to the interactive element with the background gradient classes. The full example looks like this.

```html
<a
  href="#"
  class="animate-border inline-block bg-white from-pink-500 via-red-500 to-yellow-500 p-0.5 hover:bg-gradient-to-r bg-[length:400%_400%] "
>
  <span class="block px-5 py-3 bg-white"> Get Started </span>
</a>
```
