  title: Application UI Components are Coming to HyperUI
  description: HyperUI is getting new application UI components, find out why that is and have your say on GitHub as to what is added in this new update.

Where I work ([Neon](https://neondigital.co.uk/) and [GetCandy](https://getcandy.io/)) we've developed an open source Laravel ecommerce package called, GetCandy.

[GetCandy GitHub](https://github.com/getcandy)

We're always looking to improve GetCandy and we have plans to review the admin hub in the near future. However, I'd like a head start. I'll be creating a range of application UI components that you can use in your own admin hubs and potentially, GetCandy.

The first wave of application UI components will release over the next few weeks.

Have some ideas? [Have your say on GitHub](https://github.com/markmead/hyperui/issues/73).
