  title: How to Contribute to HyperUI
  description:
---
For some, the idea of contributing to an open source project can be very daunting but please don't let that put you off. Let's walk through how you can contribute to HyperUI and get some open source work on your CV... Trust me, it makes you stand out.

## Spotted a Bug?

If you notice something that looks a little off, it could be anything from:

- Spelling
- Accessibility
- SEO

And plenty more, then please do [create an issue](https://github.com/markmead/hyperui/issues/new/choose).

Once an issue has been created I can start working on a fix. However, if you'd like to work on the fix then do let me know.

## Want to Add Something?

If you have something that you want to add to HyperUI then that's awesome, but before you dive too deep into the development, I'd recommend that you [create an issue](https://github.com/markmead/hyperui/issues/new/choose) to outline what it is that you are adding.

If you plan to add a new component then please include some examples of what the component will look like.

## Pull Request Feedback

Here's the scary part ðŸ‘»

All pull requests need to be reviewed before being merged into HyperU, which does mean that on occasion there will be feedback. Please do not be disheartened by feedback, we're all developing each other's skillset and trying to make HyperUI (and other open source projects) better.

### New Component Feedback

If you are looking to add a component to HyperUI then I will give feedback on both the design and development of the component.

For new component pull requests, I will review the work three times. If on the third review there is feedback from the first review that is not addressed, then I will close it and ask for it to be re-opened once feedback has been addressed.

If on the third review there is new feedback then that's not an issue, it's only if you have ignored feedback from the first review.

I believe this to be fair.

## Final Notes

I believe that contributing to open source is one of the best feelings for a developer, but as mentioned, it can be very daunting. I really don't want anyone to feel that way with HyperUI, so please do get involved, and let's all push HyperUI to become a better project.
