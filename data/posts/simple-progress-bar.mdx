Recently (April 2023), I added new [progress bar components](/components/application-ui/progress) to HyperUI.

Which got me thinking...

> Could you create a progress bar component with a single HTML element?

Short answer. Yes.

<BlogPreview
  previewId="progress-bar"
  previewTitle="Progress Bar Example"
  previewContainer="min-h-screen grid place-content-center p-8"
/>

This example is the [simple progress bar](/components/application-ui/progress#component-1) component.

Which approach you should take is personal preference. For me, I'd use the one with more HTML as it's easier to build upon in the future.

However, the single HTML element is a very clean approach.

It wouldn't be clean code if you were to do something like the [striped progress bar](/components/application-ui/progress#component-5) component. At that point your `class="..."` would be an unreadable mess.

<BlogPreview
  previewId="progress-bar-striped"
  previewTitle="Progress Bar Striped Example"
  previewContainer="min-h-screen grid place-content-center p-8"
/>

Oof.
