Throughout HyperUI you will see the classes `max-w-screen-xl mx-auto px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8` used to contain content. It's used on the site itself and within components.

Some of you may ask:

> Why not use the `.container` class?

Well, it's simple. If we look at the `.container` class it provides us with `max-width` sizes at different breakpoints, this results in jumpy containers. Take a look at the following example.

If you shrink and expand the preview you will see the content within the container snapping to fit the `max-width` for that breakpoint. This looks... rubbish.

Now let's use the classes I previously mentioned.

> Woah woah woah, it's all container on massive breakpoints!

Now, I prefer this. I can't stand it when a website takes up the whole width of a high resolution monitor, but if you don't want this then you're probably looking at no `max-width` at all and make it fully fluid.

But what if I want to use `.container`, then that's fine but remember to add the following to your `tailinwd.config.js` to make your life easier!

```js
theme: {
  container: {
    center: true,
    padding: {
      DEFAULT: '1rem',
      sm: '1.5rem',
      lg: '2rem'
    }
  },
}
```
