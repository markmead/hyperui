I'm pleased to announce that HyperUI will be participating in [Hacktoberfest 2022](https://hacktoberfest.com).

Before creating PRs, it's worth reading through [How to Contribute to HyperUI](/blog/how-to-contribute) as well as the [Hacktoberfest Participation Guide](https://hacktoberfest.com/participation/).

All PRs will need to be up-to the standard of previous PRs on the HyperUI project, it would be worth spending a few minutes reviewing what other contributors have done.

Please do not split out related changes onto different PRs to maximise your Hacktoberfest contributions, your PRs will be marked as `spam` pushing you closer to being banned from Hacktoberfest.

Enjoy and I look forward to approving your PRs! 🎃

Here's a list of other projects I work on that are taking part:

- [HyperJS](https://github.com/markmead/hyperjs)
- [Hypercolor](https://github.com/jordihales/hypercolor)
