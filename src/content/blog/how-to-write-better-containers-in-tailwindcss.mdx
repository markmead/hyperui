## Fluid Containers in Tailwind v4

Want a container that feels modern and fluid? Use the following:

```html
<div class="mx-auto max-w-7xl px-4">
  <!-- Content -->
</div>
```

Or set up a custom utility:

```css
@utility container {
  @apply mx-auto px-4;
}
```

Why use this approach? The default `container` class in Tailwind makes use of fixed breakpoints, this can make layouts feel rigid and less natural. By using `max-w-7xl` and padding, your content adapts smoothly.
