While gradient borders aren't heavily featured in the HyperUI components, they
add a beautiful touch to interactive elements - especially when animated. In
this tutorial, I'll show you how to create a gradient border with Tailwind CSS
and then bring it to life with animation.

## Step 1: Creating the Gradient Border

First, let's create our interactive element. For this example, I'll use an `<a>`
tag. The border effect comes from applying padding (`p-1`) which creates a 4px
space between the outer gradient background and an inner element with a solid
background color.

_Note: 4px is quite a large border and is only used for demonstration purposes.
For more subtle effects, consider using `p-px` or `p-0.5` instead._

```html
<a href="#" class="block rounded-full bg-linear-to-r from-green-300 via-blue-600 to-red-300 p-1">
  <span class="block rounded-full bg-white px-10 py-4 text-lg font-medium"> Hello there ðŸ‘‹ </span>
</a>
```

This code gives you a static gradient border. If that's all you need, you're all
set! But if you want to add animation, continue reading.

## Step 2: Animating the Border

To create the animation effect, we need to make the gradient move around the
element. Here's the complete animated example:

```html
<a
  href="#"
  class="animate-background block rounded-full bg-linear-to-r from-green-300 via-blue-600 to-red-300 bg-size-[400%_400%] p-1 [animation-duration:6s]"
>
  <span class="block rounded-full bg-white px-10 py-4 text-lg font-medium"> Hello there ðŸ‘‹ </span>
</a>
```

Let's break down the new classes that enable the animation:

`animate-background`

This extends Tailwind's animation utilities with a custom animation for moving
background gradients:

```css
@theme {
  --animate-background: background-move ease infinite;

  @keyframes background-move {
    0%,
    100% {
      background-position: 0% 50%;
    }

    50% {
      background-position: 100% 50%;
    }
  }
}
```

This animation shifts the background position back and forth, creating the
flowing gradient effect.

`bg-[length:_400%_400%]`

This enlarges the gradient to 400% of the element's size in both directions. The
larger background size is essential for the animation - it gives the gradient
room to move without showing empty space during animation.

`[animation-duration:_6s]`

This controls how quickly the animation completes one cycle. You can adjust this
value to speed up or slow down the effect.

## Step 3: Experiment with Variations

Now that you have the basic animated gradient border working, try these
variations:

- **Change the gradient colors**: Try `from-purple-500 via-pink-500 to-red-500`
  for a warmer palette
- **Adjust animation speed**: `[animation-duration:_3s]` for faster movement or
  [animation-duration:_10s] for a more subtle effect
- **Play with background size**: A smaller value like `bg-[length:_200%_200%]`
  creates a shorter animation path
- **Try different easing functions**: Use `ease-in-out` for smoother transitions
