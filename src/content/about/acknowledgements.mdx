This list does not include all of the tools and libraries used to create
HyperUI, but it does highlight those that may otherwise go unnoticed, despite
their significant contribution to the project.

## Astro Build

- [Astro](https://astro.build/)
- [Prettier (Tailwind CSS)](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/prettier-plugin-tailwindcss)
- [Shiki](https://shiki.matsu.io/)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)

It's worth mentioning [Alpine JS](https://alpinejs.dev/). Even though it's not currently used (as I've switched to [web components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components)), it's a fatastic JavaScript framework that helped with the transition from Next to Astro.

## Next Build (Pre October 27th 2025)

- [Next MDX Remote](https://github.com/hashicorp/next-mdx-remote)
- [PrismJS](https://github.com/PrismJS/prism)
- [React Intersection Observer](https://github.com/thebuilder/react-intersection-observer)
- [Rehype](https://github.com/rehypejs)
