# Select Components

<div class="max-w-prose text-pretty">
  These use the native `<select>` elements. In the future, we should be able to apply a more custom look and feel. Based on [Google I/O CSS Update](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/whats-new-css-ui-2023/#selectmenu).

<CollectionList componentsData={componentsData} />
