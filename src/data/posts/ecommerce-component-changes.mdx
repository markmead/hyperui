I recently ran a poll on [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/markmead/hyperui/discussions/441) asking if it's OK to move the eCommerce components within the [Application UI](/components/application-ui) and [Marketing](/components/marketing) categories.

Based on the results from the poll (and partially the lack of engagement) I took it that the majority are OK with this. Therefore, going forward on HyperUI there will be no eCommerce category and the components have been moved into the appropriate category.

There are some more changes being discussed on [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/markmead/hyperui/discussions) so it's worth taking a look and having your say. Thank you to everyone who helps make HyperUI a better project.
