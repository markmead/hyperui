I've heard the line...

> I'm moving to Tailwind CSS but it's been difficult as it breaks Bootstrap

At least three times, which is not a lot, but when the solution is a single line of code, it feels like a lot.

But what is the mighty line? You ask.

```js
prefix: 'tw-'
```

That's it.

Now classes like `flex` will be `tw-flex` and if you don't like `tw-` then don't use it. You can set the prefix to anything you want, even `ow2-is-a-cash-grab-` ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Sometimes you will still face issues, this is most likely due to the Tailwind CSS and Bootstrap normalize CSS conflicting. You can solve this by disabling one.

I usually disable the Tailwind CSS normalize as I want to keep the styles as close to the Bootstrap implementation while moving over.

_I know that's a little backwards, but you have to keep the clients happy!_

It's as easy as a comment to disable the Tailwind CSS normalize.

```css
/* @tailwind base; */
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

You can [read more about prefix](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/configuration#prefix) on the Tailwind CSS website.
