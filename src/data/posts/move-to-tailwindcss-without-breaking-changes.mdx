I've heard the line...

> I'm moving to Tailwind CSS but it's been difficult as it breaks Bootstrap

...at least three times. It's not a lot, but when the solution is a single line of code, it seems significant.

So, what's the magical line? You ask.

```
prefix: 'tw-'
```

That's it. Now classes like `flex` will be `tw-flex`. If you don't like `tw-`, don't use it. You can set the prefix to anything you want, even `help-` 🤷‍♂️

However, sometimes you might still encounter issues. This is likely due to conflicts between Tailwind CSS and Bootstrap normalize CSS. You can resolve this by disabling one.

I usually disable the Tailwind CSS normalize because I want to keep the styles close to the Bootstrap implementation while transitioning.

_I know that's a little backwards, but you have to keep the clients happy!_

To disable the Tailwind CSS normalize, you can easily comment it out.

```
/* @tailwind base; */
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

You can [read more about prefix](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/configuration#prefix) on the Tailwind CSS website.
