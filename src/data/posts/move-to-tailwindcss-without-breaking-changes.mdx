I've heard this a few times:

Whether you're moving from Bootstrap, Bulma, or any other CSS framework, Tailwind CSS makes it easy to avoid class name conflicts.

**The magic line?**

```css
@import 'tailwindcss' prefix(tw);
```

Add this to your CSS entry file and Tailwind will generate classes like `tw-flex` instead of `flex`. You can use any prefix you like, such as `app` or `custom`:

```css
@import 'tailwindcss' prefix(app);
```

This prevents conflicts with utility classes from other frameworks, making your migration much smoother.

**What about CSS resets?**

Most CSS frameworks include their own CSS resets (normalize/base styles). If you notice style conflicts, you can disable Tailwind’s base styles by omitting the base import:

```css
/* @import "tailwindcss/base"; */
@import 'tailwindcss/components';
@import 'tailwindcss/utilities';
```

This keeps your previous framework’s styles intact while you transition.

For more details, check out the [Tailwind CSS docs on prefix](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/configuration#prefix).
