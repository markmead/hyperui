_If you are using these gradients more than once, it's worth adding them to the Tailwind CSS config._

The syntax for creating a gradient looks confusing, but it's easy to understand once you realise that spaces are replaced with underscores. Take the following example:

<Preview
  previewId="jit-basic-gradient"
  previewTitle="JIT Basic Gradient Example"
/>

In CSS this would be:

```css
background-image: linear-gradient(180deg, #eab308 40%, #a855f7 60%, #3b82f6);
```

The underscores after commas are personal choice, I leave them in for readability but you can remove them.

## Conic Gradients in Tailwind CSS with JIT

For this I've used [Hypercolor](https://hypercolor.dev) to find a `conic-gradient` for the example.

Here's a preview of how that looks:

<Preview
  previewId="jit-conic-gradient"
  previewTitle="JIT Conic Gradient Example"
/>

Which results in the follow CSS:

```css
background-image: conic-gradient(at left center, #eab308, #a855f7, #3b82f6);
```

## Radial Gradients in Tailwind CSS with JIT

Once again I'm using [Hypercolor](https://hypercolor.dev) to find a `radial-gradient` for the example.

Here's a preview of how that looks:

<Preview
  previewId="jit-radial-gradient"
  previewTitle="JIT Radial Gradient Example"
/>

Which results in the follow CSS:

```css
background-image: radial-gradient(at center bottom, #fde68a, #7c3aed, #0c4a6e);
```
