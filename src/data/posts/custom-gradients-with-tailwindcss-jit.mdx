## What is JIT?

Since v3, JIT has been the default in Tailwind CSS and has bought a lot of power to the framework. One of the best additions are [arbitrary values](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/adding-custom-styles#using-arbitrary-values), these allow you to replace custom CSS with Tailwind CSS like classes.

### Without Tailwind CSS JIT

```html
<div class="floating-alert absolute p-4">Hello World! ðŸ‘‹</div>
```

And for the CSS...

```css
.floating-alert {
  bottom: 5px;
  right: 5px;
}
```

### With Tailwind CSS JIT

```html
<div class="absolute bottom-[5px] right-[5px] p-4">Hello World! ðŸ‘‹</div>
```

The benefit here is keeping everything within the HTML, this means:

- Less switching between files
- No need to update Tailwind CSS config
- Easily use Tailwind CSS breakpoints `top-[2px] sm:top-[3px] lg:top-[5px]`

## Creating Gradients with Tailwind CSS JIT

_If you are using these gradients more than once, it's worth adding them to the Tailwind CSS config._

The syntax for creating a gradient looks confusing, but it's easy to understand once you realise that spaces are replaced with underscores. Take the following example:

<BlogPreview
  previewId="jit-basic-gradient"
  previewTitle="JIT Basic Gradient Example"
/>

In CSS this would be:

```css
background-image: linear-gradient(180deg, #eab308 40%, #a855f7 60%, #3b82f6);
```

The underscores after commas are personal choice, I leave them in for readability but you can remove them.

## Conic Gradients in Tailwind CSS with JIT

For this I've used [Hypercolor](https://hypercolor.dev) to find a `conic-gradient` for the example.

Here's a preview of how that looks:

<BlogPreview
  previewId="jit-conic-gradient"
  previewTitle="JIT Conic Gradient Example"
/>

Which results in the follow CSS:

```css
background-image: conic-gradient(at left center, #eab308, #a855f7, #3b82f6);
```

## Radial Gradients in Tailwind CSS with JIT

Once again I'm using [Hypercolor](https://hypercolor.dev) to find a `radial-gradient` for the example.

Here's a preview of how that looks:

<BlogPreview
  previewId="jit-radial-gradient"
  previewTitle="JIT Radial Gradient Example"
/>

Which results in the follow CSS:

```css
background-image: radial-gradient(at center bottom, #fde68a, #7c3aed, #0c4a6e);
```
