## Creating Gradients with Tailwind CSS JIT

_If you're using these gradients more than once, it's worth adding them to the Tailwind CSS config._

The syntax for creating a gradient might seem confusing, but it's easy to understand when you see that spaces are replaced with underscores. Here's an example:

<BlogPreview previewId="jit-basic-gradient" previewTitle="JIT Basic Gradient Example" />

In CSS, this would be:

```
background-image: linear-gradient(180deg, #eab308 40%, #a855f7 60%, #3b82f6);
```

The underscores after the commas are a personal choice. I leave them in for readability, but you can remove them.

## Conic Gradients in Tailwind CSS with JIT

For this, I've used [Hypercolor](https://hypercolor.dev/) to find a `conic-gradient` for the example.

Here's a preview of how it looks:

<BlogPreview previewId="jit-conic-gradient" previewTitle="JIT Conic Gradient Example" />

This results in the following CSS:

```
background-image: conic-gradient(at left center, #eab308, #a855f7, #3b82f6);
```

## Radial Gradients in Tailwind CSS with JIT

Again, I'm using [Hypercolor](https://hypercolor.dev/) to find a `radial-gradient` for the example.

Here's a preview of how it looks:

<BlogPreview previewId="jit-radial-gradient" previewTitle="JIT Radial Gradient Example" />

This results in the following CSS:

```
background-image: radial-gradient(at center bottom, #fde68a, #7c3aed, #0c4a6e);
```
