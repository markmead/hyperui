Throughout HyperUI, you will see the classes `max-w-screen-xl mx-auto px-4` used to contain content. This can be observed on the website and within the components.

You might be wondering...

> Why not use the `.container` class?

Great question.

Let's examine the `.container` class [documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/container) on the Tailwind CSS website.

It provides `max-width` sizes at different breakpoints, which results in the content within the container adjusting to that size as the breakpoint is reached.

[Container Example](https://play.tailwindcss.com/b5FKBhVHw7?layout=preview&size=1866x900)

If you shrink or expand the preview, you will see the content within the container snapping.

## A More Fluid Container

Here's the same preview, but using the classes I mentioned at the start of this blog post.

[Fluid Example](https://play.tailwindcss.com/vwHBxhrJMC?layout=preview&size=1866x900)

As you can see, it's more fluid. You reach the breakpoint where `max-w-screen-xl` is no longer applied, and then the padding is used to contain the content. To create a fully fluid container, you can remove the `max-w-screen-xl` class.

Let's compare the two.

[Container vs Fluid Example](https://play.tailwindcss.com/A7HdMDPg0O?layout=preview&size=1866x900)

One argument for the `.container` approach is that the content is wider on larger screens. However, to address this, you can use `max-w-screen-2xl` instead of `max-w-screen-xl`.

## Edit the Config and Write Less Code

One final note: if you are using the `.container` approach and find yourself writing `container mx-auto` often, you can do the following.

```
theme: {
  container: {
    center: true,

    // Optional
    padding: {
      DEFAULT: '1rem',
      sm: '1.5rem',
      lg: '2rem'
    }
  },
}
```
