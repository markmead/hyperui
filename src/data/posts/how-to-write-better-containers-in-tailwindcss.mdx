## Fluid Containers in Tailwind v4

Want a container that feels modern and fluid? Use:

```html
<div class="mx-auto max-w-screen-xl px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8">
  <!-- Content -->
</div>
```

Or set up a custom utility:

```css
@utility container {
  @apply mx-auto px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8;
}
```

Why use this approach? The default `.container` class in Tailwind sets fixed widths at breakpoints, which can make layouts feel rigid and less natural. By using `max-w-screen-xl` and padding, your content adapts smoothly to any screen size and always stays visually balanced.
