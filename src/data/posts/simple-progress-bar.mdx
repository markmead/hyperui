In April 2023, I added new [progress bar components](/components/application-ui/progress) to HyperUI and it led me to ponder:

> Is it possible to create a progress bar component using just one HTML element?

The answer is yes.

<BlogPreview
  previewId="progress-bar"
  previewTitle="Progress Bar Example"
  previewContainer="min-h-screen grid place-content-center p-8"
/>

This example showcases the [simple progress bar](/components/application-ui/progress#component-1) component.

The approach you choose boils down to personal preference. I tend to use the one with more HTML as it provides a more solid foundation for future enhancements.

However, using a single HTML element is a very neat approach.

But, if you were to design something like the [striped progress bar](/components/application-ui/progress#component-5) component, the single element approach wouldn't result in clean code. Your `class="..."` would become a jumble of text that's hard to read.

<BlogPreview
  previewId="progress-bar-striped"
  previewTitle="Progress Bar Striped Example"
  previewContainer="min-h-screen grid place-content-center p-8"
/>

But, it's not actually as bad as it might seem! 🤷‍♀️
