If you prefer not to update the Tailwind CSS config, you can use JIT to write the following.

```
<h1 class="[text-shadow:_0_1px_0_rgb(0_0_0_/_40%)]">Hello</h1>
```

Alternatively, to use classes like `shadow-red-500`, you can do this.

```
<h1 class="[text-shadow:_0_1px_0_var(--tw-shadow-color)]">Hello</h1>
```

## Why No Support? 🤷‍♂️

Currently, Tailwind CSS does not officially support `text-shadow` classes. Adam Wathan, the creator of Tailwind CSS, recently tweeted:

> What CSS feature that Tailwind doesn't have baked in do you find yourself getting the most irrationally angry about? Need ideas for v3.1

> In before text-shadow-sm — harder than it sounds, one day, I'm sorry

The issue isn't the implementation, but the execution. Deciding the default shadows to include has proven challenging.

> The hard part is choosing the default shadows to include. I've spent probably 20 hours on the problem so far and still haven't come up with a good way to approach it. What are all the problems they solve, how many sizes do we need, do they need to support colors, etc.

But, while we wait, we can add this feature ourselves.

## Adding Text shadow-sm Classes to Tailwind CSS

Add the following to your `tailwind.config.js`:

```
const plugin = require('tailwindcss/plugin')

module.exports = {
  theme: {
    extend: {
      textShadow: {
        sm: '0 1px 2px var(--tw-shadow-color)',
        DEFAULT: '0 2px 4px var(--tw-shadow-color)',
        lg: '0 8px 16px var(--tw-shadow-color)',
      },
    },
  },
  plugins: [
    plugin(function ({ matchUtilities, theme }) {
      matchUtilities(
        {
          'text-shadow': (value) => ({
            textShadow: value,
          }),
        },
        { values: theme('textShadow') }
      )
    }),
  ],
}
```

That's it.

Now, you can write `text-shadow-sm shadow-red-500` and a beautiful red text shadow-sm will appear, created with Tailwind CSS and no custom CSS.

I followed the [adding plugins documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/plugins#adding-utilities) to achieve this.

Our code adds the following Tailwind CSS classes:

- `text-shadow`
- `text-shadow-sm`
- `text-shadow-lg`

You can add as many as you like. Check out the [Tailwind Play](https://play.tailwindcss.com/oniahnu34l) example.

The new classes will appear in [Tailwind CSS IntelliSense](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/editor-setup#intelli-sense-for-vs-code) when typing `text-sh`, for instance.

Note the use of `var(--tw-shadow-color)`. This is important as it allows us to use Tailwind CSS `shadow-[color]` classes with the `text-shadow` classes we've added.

And that's it.

That's all it takes to add `text-shadow` support to Tailwind CSS while it's not in the core.
