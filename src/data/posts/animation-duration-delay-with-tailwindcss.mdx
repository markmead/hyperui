It's worth noting you can use JIT for one off classes, such as:

- `[animation-duration:_2s]`
- `[animation-delay:_0.5s]`
- `[animation-timing-function:_linear]`

---

I think it's a little odd that Tailwind CSS doesn't include this but here we go.

## Adding Animation Duration Classes to Tailwind CSS

In your `tailwind.config.js` add the following:

```js
const plugin = require('tailwindcss/plugin')

module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    plugin(function ({ matchUtilities, theme }) {
      matchUtilities(
        {
          'animate-duration': (value) => ({
            animationDuration: value,
          }),
        },
        { values: theme('transitionDuration') }
      )
    }),
  ],
}
```

This will add the `duration` classes used for transitions to animations with the prefix `animate-`:

- `animate-duration-0`
- `animate-duration-75`
- `animate-duration-100`
- `animate-duration-150`
- `animate-duration-200`
- `animate-duration-300`
- `animate-duration-500`
- `animate-duration-700`
- `animate-duration-1000`

## Adding Animation Delay Classes to Tailwind CSS

In your `tailwind.config.js` add the following:

```js
const plugin = require('tailwindcss/plugin')

module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    plugin(function ({ matchUtilities, theme }) {
      matchUtilities(
        {
          'animate-delay': (value) => ({
            animationDelay: value,
          }),
        },
        { values: theme('transitionDelay') }
      )
    }),
  ],
}
```

This will add the `delay` classes used for transitions to animations with the prefix `animate-`:

- `animate-delay-0`
- `animate-delay-75`
- `animate-delay-100`
- `animate-delay-150`
- `animate-delay-200`
- `animate-delay-300`
- `animate-delay-500`
- `animate-delay-700`
- `animate-delay-1000`

## Adding Animation Easing Classes to Tailwind CSS

In your `tailwind.config.js` add the following:

```js
const plugin = require('tailwindcss/plugin')

module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    plugin(function ({ matchUtilities, theme }) {
      matchUtilities(
        {
          'animate-ease': (value) => ({
            animationTimingFunction: value,
          }),
        },
        { values: theme('transitionTimingFunction') }
      )
    }),
  ],
}
```

This will add the `ease` classes used for transitions to animations with the prefix `animate-`:

- `animate-ease`
- `animate-ease-linear`
- `animate-ease-in`
- `animate-ease-out`
- `animate-ease-in-out`

Missed an example? Take a look at this [Tailwind Play](https://play.tailwindcss.com/ZD4We65876) example.

The classes that have been added will appear in [Tailwind CSS IntelliSense](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/editor-setup#intelli-sense-for-vs-code).

It also means you can use JIT, for example:

- `animation-duration-[5s]`
- `animation-delay-[0.25s]`
- `animation-ease-[cubic-bezier(.17,_.67,_.83,_.67)]`

And there we have it.

That's all it takes to add animation duration, delay and easing support to Tailwind CSS while it's not in the core. Maybe it will be in the future.
