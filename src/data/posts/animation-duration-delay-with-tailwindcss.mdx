It's important to mention that you can use JIT for one-off classes, such as:

- `[animation-duration:_2s]`
- `[animation-delay:_0.5s]`
- `[animation-timing-function:_linear]`

---

It may seem strange that Tailwind CSS doesn't include this, but let's proceed.

## Adding Animation Duration Classes to Tailwind CSS

To do this, add the following to your `tailwind.config.js`:

```
const plugin = require('tailwindcss/plugin')

module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    plugin(function ({ matchUtilities, theme }) {
      matchUtilities(
        {
          'animate-duration': (value) => ({
            animationDuration: value,
          }),
        },
        { values: theme('transitionDuration') }
      )
    }),
  ],
}
```

This will add the `duration` classes used for transitions to animations with the `animate-` prefix:

- `animate-duration-0`
- `animate-duration-75`
- `animate-duration-100`
- `animate-duration-150`
- `animate-duration-200`
- `animate-duration-300`
- `animate-duration-500`
- `animate-duration-700`
- `animate-duration-1000`

## Adding Animation Delay Classes to Tailwind CSS

Add the following to your `tailwind.config.js`:

```
const plugin = require('tailwindcss/plugin')

module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    plugin(function ({ matchUtilities, theme }) {
      matchUtilities(
        {
          'animate-delay': (value) => ({
            animationDelay: value,
          }),
        },
        { values: theme('transitionDelay') }
      )
    }),
  ],
}
```

This will add the `delay` classes used for transitions to animations with the `animate-` prefix:

- `animate-delay-0`
- `animate-delay-75`
- `animate-delay-100`
- `animate-delay-150`
- `animate-delay-200`
- `animate-delay-300`
- `animate-delay-500`
- `animate-delay-700`
- `animate-delay-1000`

## Adding Animation Easing Classes to Tailwind CSS

Add the following to your `tailwind.config.js`:

```
const plugin = require('tailwindcss/plugin')

module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    plugin(function ({ matchUtilities, theme }) {
      matchUtilities(
        {
          'animate-ease': (value) => ({
            animationTimingFunction: value,
          }),
        },
        { values: theme('transitionTimingFunction') }
      )
    }),
  ],
}
```

This will add the `ease` classes used for transitions to animations with the `animate-` prefix:

- `animate-ease`
- `animate-ease-linear`
- `animate-ease-in`
- `animate-ease-out`
- `animate-ease-in-out`

Check out the [Tailwind Play](https://play.tailwindcss.com/DFSnsN3Vc6) example.

The added classes will appear in [Tailwind CSS IntelliSense](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/editor-setup#intelli-sense-for-vs-code).

This also means you can use JIT, for example:

- `animate-duration-[5s]`
- `animate-delay-[0.25s]`
- `animate-ease-[cubic-bezier(.17,_.67,_.83,_.67)]`

---

And that's it.

That's all you need to do to add animation duration, delay, and easing support to Tailwind CSS while it's not yet part of the core. Perhaps it will be included in the future.
