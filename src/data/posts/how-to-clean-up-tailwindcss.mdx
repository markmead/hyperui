It's no secret that Tailwind CSS can make your markup very messy, but we can take some steps into improving this. Probably the most common is to delegate classes to the parent element.

Take the following example.

```html
<ul>
  <li class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-900">...</li>
  <li class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-900">...</li>
  <li class="bg-gray-100 text-sm font-medium text-gray-900">...</li>
</ul>
```

There's a lot of repetition here, this can be helped by moving the repeated classes to the parent element.

```html
<ul class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-900">
  <li>...</li>
  <li>...</li>
  <li class="bg-gray-100">...</li>
</ul>
```

In my opinion, this is much better and is the way that I write Tailwind CSS. However, what if we are using classes that cannot be delegated to the parent?

Classes such as `whitespace-nowrap`, `px-8`, `rotate-3` and many more, cannot be applied to child elements from the parent, you have some classes like `whitespace-nowrap` that will do nothing, and other such as `rotate-3` that will break your UI ü§Ø.

However, there's a solution...

### Enter JIT

If you're not too sure what JIT is then here's a brief description from my [How to Create Custom Gradients in Tailwind CSS with JIT](/blog/custom-gradients-with-tailwindcss-jit).

> Since v3, JIT has been the default in Tailwind CSS and has bought a lot of power to the framework. One of the best additions are [arbitrary values](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/adding-custom-styles#using-arbitrary-values), these allow you to replace custom CSS with Tailwind CSS like classes.

In the following example there are a few classes we can delegate to the parent.

- `whitespace-nowrap`
- `p-4`
- `text-sm`
- `font-medium`

Looking at those we know that `whitespace-nowrap` and `p-4` cannot be delegated to the parent without JIT.

```html
<ul>
  <li class="whitespace-nowrap p-4 text-sm font-medium">...</li>
  <li class="whitespace-nowrap p-4 text-sm font-medium">...</li>
  <li class="whitespace-nowrap bg-gray-100 p-4 text-sm font-medium">...</li>
</ul>
```

Here's how it could look without JIT.

```html
<ul class="text-sm font-medium">
  <li class="whitespace-nowrap p-4">...</li>
  <li class="whitespace-nowrap p-4">...</li>
  <li class="whitespace-nowrap bg-gray-100 p-4">...</li>
</ul>
```

It's OK, but we can do better... ü•Å

```html
<ul class="text-sm font-medium [&>*]:whitespace-nowrap [&>*]:p-4">
  <li>...</li>
  <li>...</li>
  <li class="bg-gray-100">...</li>
</ul>
```

And that's it. Job done.

Now you might be asking... "What is `[&>*]`? It's not Tailwind"

And you're kind of right, it's actually CSS.

_If you're a believer of Tailwind CSS being "inline CSS" then this should really fuel that pointless anger_

So it's CSS, but what does it look like.

```css
& > * {
  ...;
}
```

This should look quite familiar, but in case you haven't used it, or have used it but you're not too sure what it does, here's a brief description.

> `[&>*]` or `& > * {}` translates to "select all **first level** children in this element"

In our example the `&` is the `<ul>` and the `*` is the `<li>` elements. Here's how that would look in CSS.

```css
ul > li {
  ...;
}
```

And from that, all we're doing is applying CSS but with Tailwind CSS utilities.

```css
ul {
  font-size: 0.875rem; // text-sm
  line-height: 1.25rem; // text-sm
  font-weight: 500; // font-medium
}

ul > li {
  white-space: nowrap; // whitespace-nowrap
  padding: 1rem; // p-4
}
```

Here's a more [built-out example using a table component](https://play.tailwindcss.com/pJxSAPRw22) from HyperUI as you can see, it cleans up a lot.

I'm on the fence about this approach, as arbitrary classes have some downsides:

- Confusing to read
- Confusing to write
- Messy markup

> This post is called "One Simple Trick to Cleaning Up Tailwind CSS Code" and yet a downside of arbitrary classes is "messy markup"

It's more of an opinion, when I first saw them I thought they looked messy, but when used correctly they can really help clean up your markup.

And of course, they're optional. If you don't want to use them, you don't have to.
