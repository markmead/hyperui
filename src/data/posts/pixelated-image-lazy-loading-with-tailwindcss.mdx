A few years ago, I was tasked with building a pixelated image lazy loader, which I thought would be a significant challenge. However, the solution turned out to be relatively straightforward.

1. Set the image `src` to a tiny version of the image.
2. Apply the CSS `image-rendering: pixelated` to the image.
3. Implement your lazy loading logic.
4. Once loaded, replace the image `src` and switch the CSS to `image-rendering: auto`.

To illustrate this effect, here's a CodePen I made a few years ago - [Pixelated Lazy Loading](https://codepen.io/markmead/pen/JjPmObK).

But how does this translate to Tailwind CSS? The process is exactly the same.

Here's a version that uses Tailwind CSS to achieve the same effect, with Alpine JS substituted for JavaScript.

If you disregard Alpine JSâ€”which is only used for the lazy loading logicâ€”the approach remains the same. Currently, Tailwind CSS does not support `image-rendering` classes, so we use the arbitrary properties syntax to write the necessary CSS.

That's it! I'd recommend experimenting with the size of the small image, as it can significantly alter the pixelated effect.
