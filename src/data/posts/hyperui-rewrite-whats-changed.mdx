## Why Rewrite?

I've known I wanted to rewrite HyperUI for a few months now, however, I wanted the rewrite to have meaning and to provide a benefit to myself and contributors.

I believe, that as developers we fall into the trap of constantly rewriting what we've done. As an example of that, I've had three different personal websites in a year which all do the same thing and if anything, the latest version does less than the first version.

However, that no longer applies as I want changes to have meaning and progress the projects (in this case HyperUI) forward.

So, what was the reason behind the HyperUI rewrite...

> HyperUI is a mixture of React and Typescript code that comes from other projects, code that I've written to match the structure of the code from the other projects and code that I've written how I'd like it to be written but with adjustments so it matches the rest of the project.

_The other projects referenced come from [https://nextjs.org/examples](https://nextjs.org/examples)._

In short, the React and Typescript code of HyperUI didn't feel like it was mine.

Here's how I changed that... ü•Å

### Added

- Added the [fast-glob](https://github.com/mrmlnc/fast-glob) package to slim down the `tailwind.config.js`
- Added a `src` folder to hold the React code that powers the site
- Added a `_document.tsx` file to control the HTML including the `lang` attribute
- Added the [tailwind-prettier-plugin](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/prettier-plugin-tailwindcss) as not everyone uses [headwind](https://github.com/heybourn/headwind)
- Added a "Skip to main content" button for those using keyboard navigation
- Added more type checking through Typescript `type` and `interface` objects
- Added scroll restoration through the `next.config.js` (experimental feature)
- Added social links to the site footer

### Updated

- Formatted all files with the [tailwind-prettier-plugin](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/prettier-plugin-tailwindcss)
- Swapped to the [SWC](https://swc.rs/) compiler for JavaScript
- Improved the names of functions, components and variables to be more declarative

```js
// Before
const [code, setCode] = useState<string>()
const [html, setHtml] = useState<string>()
const [view, setView] = useState<boolean>(true)
const [width, setWidth] = useState<string>('100%')
const [variant, setVariant] = useState<string>('base')
const [themed, setThemed] = useState<boolean>(false)
const [dark, setDark] = useState<boolean>(false)
const [loading, setLoading] = useState<boolean>(false)

// After
const [componentCode, setComponentCode] = useState<string>()
const [componentHtml, setComponentHtml] = useState<string>()
const [showPreview, setShowPreview] = useState<boolean>(true)
const [previewWidth, setPreviewWidth] = useState<string>('100%')
const [selectedVariant, setSelectedVariant] = useState<string>('base')
const [hasDarkMode, setHasDarkMode] = useState<boolean>(false)
const [isDarkMode, setIsDarkMode] = useState<boolean>(false)
const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState<boolean>(false)
```

- Cleaned up the site header to be less cluttered on desktop and mobile
- Switched to a more familiar syntax for React components

```js
type Props = {
  hasDarkMode: boolean
  isDarkMode: boolean
  handleSetIsDarkMode: CallableFunction
}

// Before
const Dark: FunctionComponent<Props> = ({
  hasDarkMode,
  isDarkMode,
  handleSetIsDarkMode,
}) => {}

// After
function Dark({ hasDarkMode, isDarkMode, handleSetIsDarkMode }: Props) {}
```

- Swapped the name of `{global,build}.css` files to `tailwind.css`
- Included the `tailwind.css` build file to `.gitignore`
- Renamed the sitemap config to be more inline with other configs
- Cleaned up the [How to Contribute](https://www.hyperui.dev/blog/how-to-contribute) blog following changes
- Improved the Typescript `type` and `interface` objects
- Improve the `lib` functions that are used for data fetching
- Fixed an issue with dark mode not applying when switching preview mode
- Cleaned up the React code for the preview component

### Removed

- Remove old code that was no longer use before or after the update
- Removed options from `tsconfig.json` that were relaxing the rules
- Removed the `layout.tsx` component
- Remove unused `interface` objects that were underused
- Removed unnecessary information from the README
- Removed the breakpoint slider component `range.tsx`
- Removed the local declaration from the `next.config.js`

Yup... There were a lot of changes, I believe 440+ files, but that does include the Tailwind CSS components.

It's worth noting that pull requests and commit messages are now adopting a more descriptive approach as well, for example.

```shell
// Before
feat/error-page-components

// After
Feature - Added new error page components
```

You can see the [full pull request](https://github.com/markmead/hyperui/pull/173) on GitHub.

Overall, I've been enjoying working with React and Typescript a lot more on HyperUI and this rewrite helped fix a few issues and make some improvements to the site.
