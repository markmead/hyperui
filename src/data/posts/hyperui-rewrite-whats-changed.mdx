As developers we fall into the trap of feeling the need to constantly rewrite what we've done. As an example of that, I've had three different personal website in a year... Why? Boredom.

I wanted the rewrite of HyperUI to not be driven by boredom, it needed to have a meaning and to provide a benefit to myself and contributors.

The meaning I found was to rewrite HyperUI how I would write a React with Typescript application. It was 75% there, but there was some code that I used from a Next JS starter kit that wasn't in the style that I like to write in. Therefore, here's what's been changed... ü•Å

### Added

- Added the [fast-glob](https://github.com/mrmlnc/fast-glob) package to slim down the `tailwind.config.js`
- Added a `src` folder to hold the React code base that powers the site
- Added a `_document.tsx` file to control the base HTML including the `lang` attribute
- Added the [tailwind-prettier-plugin](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/prettier-plugin-tailwindcss) as not everyone uses [headwind](https://github.com/heybourn/headwind)
- Added a "Skip to main content" button for those using keyboards
- Added more type checking through Typescript `type` and `interface`
- Added scroll restoration through the `next.config.js` (experimental feature)

### Updated

- Formatted all files with the [tailwind-prettier-plugin](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/prettier-plugin-tailwindcss)
- Swapped to [SWC](https://swc.rs/) compiler for JavaScript
- Removed the local declaration from the `next.config.js`
- Improved the names of functions, components and variables to be more declarative

```js
// Before
const [code, setCode] = useState<string>()
const [html, setHtml] = useState<string>()
const [view, setView] = useState<boolean>(true)
const [width, setWidth] = useState<string>('100%')
const [variant, setVariant] = useState<string>('base')
const [themed, setThemed] = useState<boolean>(false)
const [dark, setDark] = useState<boolean>(false)
const [loading, setLoading] = useState<boolean>(false)

// After
const [componentCode, setComponentCode] = useState<string>()
const [componentHtml, setComponentHtml] = useState<string>()
const [showPreview, setShowPreview] = useState<boolean>(true)
const [previewWidth, setPreviewWidth] = useState<string>('100%')
const [selectedVariant, setSelectedVariant] = useState<string>('base')
const [hasDarkMode, setHasDarkMode] = useState<boolean>(false)
const [isDarkMode, setIsDarkMode] = useState<boolean>(false)
const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState<boolean>(false)
```

- Cleaned up the site header to be less cluttered on desktop and mobile
- Switched to a more familiar syntax for React components

```js
type Props = {
  hasDarkMode: boolean
  isDarkMode: boolean
  handleSetIsDarkMode: CallableFunction
}

// Before
const Dark: FunctionComponent<Props> = ({
  hasDarkMode,
  isDarkMode,
  handleSetIsDarkMode,
}) => {}

// After
function Dark({ hasDarkMode, isDarkMode, handleSetIsDarkMode }: Props) {}
```

- Swapped the name of `{global,build}.css` files to `tailwind.css`
- Included the `tailwind.css` build file to `.gitignorge`
- Renamed the sitemap config from `next-sitemap.config.js` to `sitemap.config.js` to be more inline with other configs
- Cleaned up the [How to Contribute](https://www.hyperui.dev/blog/how-to-contribute) blog following changes
- Improved the Typescript `type` and `interface` objects
- Improve the `lib` functions that were used for data fetching
- Fixed an issue with dark mode not applying when switching preview mode
- Cleaned up the React for the preview component

### Removed

- Remove old code that was no longer use before or after the update
- Removed options from `tsconfig.json` that were relaxing the rules
- Removed the `layout.tsx` component
- Remove unused `interface` objects that were underused
- Removed unnecessary information from the README
- Removed the breakpoint slider component `range.tsx`

Yup... Quite a few changes. However, so far, so good. I've been enjoying working with React and Typescript a lot more on HyperUI.

It's worth noting as well that pull requests and commit messages are now adopting a more descriptive approach, for example.

```shell
// Before
feat/error-page-components

// After
Feature - Added new error page components
```

It's a small change but one that should help.
