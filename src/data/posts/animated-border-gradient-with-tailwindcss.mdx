Creating an elegant animated border shouldn't be difficult or messy with Tailwind CSS. Here's a straightforward and clean approach.

## Faking the Border

First, we need our interactive element. For this example, I'll use an `<a>` tag. We create an illusion of a border by using a background color and padding.

```
<a href="#" class="inline-block bg-white p-0.5">
  <span class="block bg-gray-900 px-5 py-3 text-white"> Get Started </span>
</a>
```

Inside this, we add a `<span>` element that contains the text content of the element, along with the desired padding for our button or link.

## Adding the Gradient

Next, we add the gradient.

I'll use a pre-made Tailwind CSS gradient from [Hypercolor](https://hypercolor.dev/).

We apply the gradient to the interactive element with the faux border.

```
<a href="#" class="inline-block bg-white from-pink-500 via-red-500 to-yellow-500 p-0.5">
  <span class="block bg-gray-900 px-5 py-3 text-white"> Get Started </span>
</a>
```

You might worry that the gradient classes added will overwrite the `bg-white`, but it won't. For that to happen, we need to add the gradient direction class, which is done on hover.

### Applying the Hover Effect

We can enhance what we've done by adding two more classes: one is a default Tailwind CSS class applied on hover, and the other is always applied, requiring some JIT (Just-In-Time) magic.

```
<a
  href="#"
  class="inline-block bg-white from-pink-500 via-red-500 to-yellow-500 bg-[length:_400%_400%] p-0.5 hover:bg-gradient-to-r"
>
  <span class="block bg-gray-900 px-5 py-3 text-white"> Get Started </span>
</a>
```

Let's break these down.

`hover:bg-gradient-to-r`

This applies the gradient direction class only on hover, which will display the gradient instead of `bg-white`.

`bg-[length:400%_400%]`

This enlarges the gradient, enabling us to animate it. Without this class, the gradient will appear static and won't animate.

### Animating the Gradient

Now, let's animate.

First, we need to make some additions to our Tailwind CSS config.

```
theme: {
  extend: {
    animation: {
      border: 'background ease infinite',
    },
    keyframes: {
      background: {
        '0%, 100%': { backgroundPosition: '0% 50%' },
        '50%': { backgroundPosition: '100% 50%' },
      },
    },
  },
}
```

Here, we're creating an animation with the class `animate-background` using the `background` keyframes. This moves the gradient.

Finally, we add the `animate-background` class to the interactive element with the gradient classes.

You can use `hover:animate-background` if preferred, but note that the animation will reset when you're no longer hovering, which can cause it to look a bit jumpy.

The full example looks like this.

```
<a
  href="#"
  class="animate-background inline-block bg-white from-pink-500 via-red-500 to-yellow-500 bg-[length:_400%_400%] p-0.5 [animation-duration:_6s] hover:bg-gradient-to-r"
>
  <span class="block bg-gray-900 px-5 py-3 text-white"> Get Started </span>
</a>
```

We're using the arbitrary properties syntax to write `[animation-duration:_6s]` so we can alter the `animation-duration` for each use of the effect.

Here's how it looks. I've added some extra classes to enhance the `<a>`.
