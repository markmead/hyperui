Creating a nice animated border should be difficult and with Tailwind CSS... messy. However, here's the approach that I took which was easy and clean.

## Faking the Border

First, we need our interactive element, for this example, I'll use an `<a>` to have a "border" which we are faking by using a background color and padding.

```html
<a href="#" class="inline-block bg-white p-0.5">
  <span class="block bg-gray-900 px-5 py-3 text-white"> Get Started </span>
</a>
```

Inside that, we add a `<span>` that will have the text content of the element, as well as apply the padding that we desire for our button/link.

## Adding the Gradient

Next, we need to add the gradient.

I'm going to use a pre-made Tailwind CSS gradient from [Hypercolor](https://hypercolor.dev/).

We apply the gradient to the interactive element with the fake border.

```html
<a href="#" class="inline-block bg-white from-pink-500 via-red-500 to-yellow-500 p-0.5">
  <span class="block bg-gray-900 px-5 py-3 text-white"> Get Started </span>
</a>
```

You might be concerned that the gradient classes added will override the `bg-white` but it won't, for that to happen we need to add the gradient direction class which is done on hover.

### Applying the Hover Effect

We can take what we've done and add two more classes, one is a default Tailwind CSS class which is applied on hover, the other is always applied and needs some JIT magic.

```html
<a
  href="#"
  class="inline-block bg-white from-pink-500 via-red-500 to-yellow-500 bg-[length:_400%_400%] p-0.5 hover:bg-gradient-to-r"
>
  <span class="block bg-gray-900 px-5 py-3 text-white"> Get Started </span>
</a>
```

Let's break these down.

`hover:bg-gradient-to-r`

This applies the gradient direction class only on hover which will make the gradient display instead of `bg-white`.

`bg-[length:400%_400%]`

This makes the gradient huge allowing us to apply an animation to it, without this class the gradient will appear as is and wont animate.

### Animating the Gradient

Now it's time to animate.

First, we need to make some additions to our Tailwind CSS config.

```js
theme: {
  extend: {
    animation: {
      border: 'background ease infinite',
    },
    keyframes: {
      background: {
        '0%, 100%': { backgroundPosition: '0% 50%' },
        '50%': { backgroundPosition: '100% 50%' },
      },
    },
  },
}
```

Here we're creating an animation with the class `animate-background` which is using the `background` object in the `keyframes` object. In short, this moves the gradient.

Finally, we can add the `animate-background` class to the interactive element with the gradient classes.

You can use `hover:animate-background` if preferred, but note that will reset the animation when you are no longer on hover, which can cause it to look a little jumpy.

The full example looks like this.

```html
<a
  href="#"
  class="animate-background inline-block bg-white from-pink-500 via-red-500 to-yellow-500 bg-[length:_400%_400%] p-0.5 [animation-duration:_6s] hover:bg-gradient-to-r"
>
  <span class="block bg-gray-900 px-5 py-3 text-white"> Get Started </span>
</a>
```

We're making use of an arbitrary properties syntax to write `[animation-duration:_6s]` so we can change the `animation-duration` for each use of the effect.

And here is how it looks. I've added some extra classes to make the `<a>` look nicer.
