The idea of contributing to an open-source project can be intimidating. Let's explore how you can contribute to HyperUI.

## Spotted a Bug?

If you find something that doesn't seem right, such as:

- Spelling
- Accessibility
- SEO

Or anything else, please [create an issue](https://github.com/markmead/hyperui/issues/new/choose).

Once an issue is created, we can begin discussing a solution and approach to resolving the issue.

## Want to Add Something?

If you have something to add to HyperUI, that's great! But before you dive in, I suggest you [create an issue](https://github.com/markmead/hyperui/issues/new/choose) so we can discuss what you want to add.

If you're planning to add a new component, include some examples of how the component will look.

### Pull Request Feedback

All pull requests must be reviewed before being merged into HyperUI, which means there might be feedback at times.

### Getting HyperUI Running Locally

HyperUI is a Next JS project and can be quickly set up with the following commands.

```
git clone git@github.com:markmead/hyperui.git
yarn install
yarn dev
yarn css --watch
```

### Creating a New Component

For this example, we will create a new footer component in the marketing category.

1. Create a new file in `/public/components/marketing-footers`
2. Add the new component to the components group in `/src/data/components/marketing-footers.mdx`

It should look like this.

```
components:
  21:
    title: An Amazing Footer
  22:
    title: My Awesome New Footer
```

As you can see, component files are named incrementally. Please follow this method.

You can use `container:` to position the component within the preview. However, any classes added here will be ignored when copying or viewing the component's code.

### Notes on New Components

1. Components must be written with Tailwind CSS
2. Reference used Tailwind CSS plugins in the HTML

You can see examples of point 3 in the HTML of this [input component](/components/application-ui/pagination#component-3).

### Creating a New Collection

To create a new collection, please [create an issue](https://github.com/markmead/hyperui/issues/new/choose) on GitHub. Then we can discuss the new collection and brainstorm components to add.

### New Component Feedback

If you plan to add a component to HyperUI, I will provide feedback on both the design and development of the component.

For new component pull requests, I will review the work three times. If feedback from the first review remains unaddressed by the third review, I will close the PR. If there is new feedback on the third review, it's not an issue.
