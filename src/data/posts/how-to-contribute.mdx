Contributing to open source can feel overwhelming, but getting involved with HyperUI is straightforward and rewarding. Hereâ€™s how you can help make HyperUI even better.

## Found a Bug or Have an Idea?

If you notice something offâ€”like a typo, accessibility issue, or SEO concernâ€”or if you have an idea for an improvement, please [open an issue](https://github.com/markmead/hyperui/issues/new/choose). This helps us discuss and plan the best way forward together.

## Want to Add or Improve Something?

Thinking of adding a new component or feature? Before you start, [create an issue](https://github.com/markmead/hyperui/issues/new/choose) so we can chat about your idea. For new components, sharing example designs is helpful.

### Pull Request Process

All pull requests are reviewed before merging. You may receive feedbackâ€”this is part of making HyperUI great! If feedback from the first review isnâ€™t addressed by the third review, the PR will be closed. If new feedback comes up in the third review, thatâ€™s fineâ€”just address it as usual.

### Setting Up HyperUI Locally

HyperUI runs on Next.js. To get started:

```
git clone git@github.com:markmead/hyperui.git
yarn install
yarn dev
yarn css --watch
```

### Adding a New Component

For example, to add a new footer component in the marketing category:

1. Create a new file in `/public/components/marketing/footers`.
2. Add the component to the group in `/src/data/components/marketing/footers.mdx`.

Component files are named incrementally (e.g., 21, 22, etc.). Please follow this pattern. You can use `container:` to adjust the preview positionâ€”these classes wonâ€™t affect the copied code.

#### Component Guidelines

1. Use Tailwind CSS for all components.
2. Only use official Tailwind CSS plugins. Declare any plugins used in the component object in the MDX file, for example: `plugins: ['@tailwindcss/forms']`.

See examples in the [input component](/components/application/pagination#component-3).

### Creating a New Collection

To propose a new collection, [open an issue](https://github.com/markmead/hyperui/issues/new/choose) so we can discuss and brainstorm ideas together.

### Console Warnings

When developing locally, you might see the warning: `params should be awaited before using its properties`. This can be ignoredâ€”`await` is used for `getX` functions that resolve data from `params`.
