It's not required, but I'd recommend using [@tailwindcss/forms](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss-forms) when working with inputs, it comes with some great defaults and speeds up the process of styling inputs.

If you ever find yourself working with a number input and thinking...

> Ah! I wish those stupid spinners would go away!

Then you are not alone.

They definitely have their use, but they can become a problem. Let's get rid of them.

## CSS Class (Level 1)

The solution that does not care what CSS framework you are using.

```css
.no-spinner {
  -moz-appearance: textfield;
}

.no-spinner::-webkit-outer-spin-button,
.no-spinner::-webkit-inner-spin-button {
  margin: 0;
  -webkit-appearance: none;
}
```

Perfection.

Now you can add the `no-spinner` class to your number inputs and remove the spinners.

## Tailwind CSS Class (Level 2)

```css
@layer components {
  .no-spinner {
    -moz-appearance: textfield;
  }

  .no-spinner::-webkit-outer-spin-button,
  .no-spinner::-webkit-inner-spin-button {
    margin: 0;
    -webkit-appearance: none;
  }
}
```

This "Tailwind-ifys" the solution and makes the `no-spinner` class part of Tailwind CSS.

Which means it will now appear as a suggested class if you're using [Tailwind CSS Intellisense](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/editor-setup#intelli-sense-for-vs-code).

## Tailwind CSS Class Names (Level 3)

Brace yourself.

```html
<input
  type="number"
  class="[-moz-appearance:_textfield] [&::-webkit-outer-spin-button]:m-0 [&::-webkit-outer-spin-button]:appearance-none [&::-webkit-inner-spin-button]:m-0 [&::-webkit-inner-spin-button]:appearance-none"
/>
```

Before you set fire to your eyes, please finish the blog post.

I use this approach on HyperUI components so that it works without the need of extra CSS. I do include a CSS snippet so you can copy to avoid using this approach.

You can see what I mean on this [quantity input component](/components/ecommerce/quantity-inputs#component-2).
