I recommend using [@tailwindcss/forms](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss-forms) when dealing with inputs. It provides excellent defaults and accelerates the styling process.

If you've ever wished to remove the spinners from a number input, you're not alone.

While they can be useful, they can also be problematic. So let's eliminate them.

## CSS Class (Level 1)

This solution works regardless of the CSS framework you use.

```
.no-spinner {
  -moz-appearance: textfield;
}

.no-spinner::-webkit-outer-spin-button,
.no-spinner::-webkit-inner-spin-button {
  margin: 0;
  -webkit-appearance: none;
}
```

You can now add the `no-spinner` class to your number inputs to remove the spinners.

## Tailwind CSS Class (Level 2)

```
@layer components {
  .no-spinner {
    -moz-appearance: textfield;
  }

  .no-spinner::-webkit-outer-spin-button,
  .no-spinner::-webkit-inner-spin-button {
    margin: 0;
    -webkit-appearance: none;
  }
}
```

This solution integrates the `no-spinner` class into Tailwind CSS.

Now, it will appear as a suggested class when using [Tailwind CSS Intellisense](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/editor-setup#intelli-sense-for-vs-code).

## Tailwind CSS Class Names (Level 3)

Prepare yourself.

```
<input
  type="number"
  class="[-moz-appearance:_textfield] [&::-webkit-inner-spin-button]:m-0 [&::-webkit-inner-spin-button]:appearance-none [&::-webkit-outer-spin-button]:m-0 [&::-webkit-outer-spin-button]:appearance-none"
/>
```

You can see this approach in action in this [quantity input component](/components/application-ui/quantity-inputs#component-2). Don't worry, I've included the CSS snippet as well.

Here are some examples using the Tailwind CSS methods.

<BlogPreview
  previewId="remove-number-spinners"
  previewTitle="Remove Number Spinners Example"
  previewContainer="grid min-h-screen place-content-center p-8"
/>

That's all. Which approach should you use? I suggest adding a Tailwind CSS class with `@layer`, but the choice is up to you.
